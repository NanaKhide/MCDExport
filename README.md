## THIS PLUGIN IS NOW DEPRECATED. Due to support for MCDF in various other plug-ins such as Ktisis, Brio and the current mare fork projects i don't see the reason to keep maintaining this band-aid project. Therefore i will not be updating it to SDK14.0.0 and NET10. However i will keep this repository just in case it will be useful again someday.

A bandaid fix for Gposers to export MCDF files.
Once a better alternative has been made this repo will be going on life support.
